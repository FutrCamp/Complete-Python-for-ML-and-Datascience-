This programming works contradictory to conventional model and is procedural, in which programs are organized as a sequence of commands or statements to perform.\r\n","\r\n","We can think an object as an entity that resides in memory, has a state and it's able to perform some actions. \r\n"," \r\n","More formally objects are entities that represent **instances** of a general abstract concept called **class**.

The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.\r\n","- `Abstraction`. Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers more easily make changes and additions over time.\r\n","- `Inheritance`. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.\r\n","- `Polymorphism`. Objects can take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down the need to duplicate code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"StXKLPO_Jqsv"},"source":["## **How to define classes**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Tpo2L-WTJxae"},"source":["The following python syntax defines a class:\r\n","\r\n","    class ClassName(base_classes):\r\n","        statements\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bWH9W7BOLZmm"},"source":["class Person():\r\n","  pass"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PMcQmHPKJ4Ss"},"source":["Saksham= Person()\r\n","Saksham.name=\"Saksham\"\r\n","Saksham.surname=\"Jain\"\r\n","Saksham.year_of_birth=2001"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SoCQlCoRJ7AG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614607761584,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":708,"user":{"displayName":"Saksham Jain","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggaj5_zst0doO6qb1h5s5gzxEjP4p1sPpU4TTXl=s64","userId":"05709270815513786985"}},"outputId":"066d3822-6c61-4552-9eb8-d52acda97b7d"},"source":["print(Saksham)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<__main__.Person object at 0x7f5af702bf10>\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wQApRKOHJ-PH","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614607836117,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":777,"user":{"displayName":"Saksham Jain","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggaj5_zst0doO6qb1h5s5gzxEjP4p1sPpU4TTXl=s64","userId":"05709270815513786985"}},"outputId":"6d3ef9c3-b666-4c5b-dabb-3987c8992534"},"source":["print(\"My name is {} , my surname is {} and my year of birth is {}\".format(Saksham.name,Saksham.surname,Saksham.year_of_birth))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["My name is Saksham , my surname is Jain and my year of birth is 2001\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YuG6fcRyJ_V3"},"source":["class Person:\r\n","  def __init__(self,name,surname,year_of_birth):\r\n","    self.name1=name\r\n","    self.surname1=surname\r\n","    self.year_of_birth1=year_of_birth"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cragRotwJQ69"},"source":["Saksham = Person(\"Saksham\",\"Jain\",2001)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N7j3L-cgJX-s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614608324432,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":889,"user":{"displayName":"Saksham Jain","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggaj5_zst0doO6qb1h5s5gzxEjP4p1sPpU4TTXl=s64","userId":"05709270815513786985"}},"outputId":"541a781f-e98e-4b65-d875-3c934b069264"},"source":["print(Saksham)\r\n","print(\"My name is {} , my surname is {} and my year of birth is {}\".format(Saksham.name1,Saksham.surname1,Saksham.year_of_birth1))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<__main__.Person object at 0x7f5af716ff90>\n","My name is Saksham , my surname is Jain and my year of birth is 2001\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ao8wvmCzKGQX"},"source":["####  Methods"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Mg69YrYmKIEB","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614608520875,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":740,"user":{"displayName":"Saksham Jain","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggaj5_zst0doO6qb1h5s5gzxEjP4p1sPpU4TTXl=s64","userId":"05709270815513786985"}},"outputId":"63080cfd-d66c-4df9-e436-a9d2692f66a9"},"source":["class Person:\r\n","    def __init__(a, name, surname, year_of_birth):\r\n","        a.name = name\r\n","        a.surname = surname\r\n","        a.year_of_birth = year_of_birth\r\n","    \r\n","    def age(a, current_year):\r\n","        return current_year - a.year_of_birth\r\n","    \r\n","    def __str__(a): # this way __str__ method has overwritten as earlier address of object give... now valuable info given\r\n","        return \"{} {} was born in {} .\".format(a.name,a.surname,a.year_of_birth)\r\n","    \r\n","Saksham = Person(\"Saksham\", \"Jain\", 2001)\r\n","print(Saksham)\r\n","print(Saksham.age(2021))\r\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Saksham Jain was born in 2001 .\n","20\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nkfsvNXaKMvf"},"source":["We defined two more methods `age` and  `__str__`.
